Greetings! This is Renjie's Webpage! Lemme tell you something about myself~

A Little Background
======
Greetings! My name is Renjie PI, I'm an undergraduate student majoring in computer engineering at the University of Hong Kong. I grew up in a city called Shihezi in Xinjiang, China, where I spent most of my childhood. I've been to Hawaii for a year when I was 13 years old, that's when I improved my English proficiency and never had to listen to English class after I went back home.

Research Interests
======
I'm broadly interested in the area of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. I think our generation has met the golden era of AI, the performance of hardware has been boosted to another level, various deep learning platforms are out there for our convenience, so many talented researchers are willing to devote their time and effort into this community. I'm one of the lucky ones who got the chance to work with some very gifted AI researchers during my internship at Huawei's Noah Ark Lab. My main focus at Huawei was Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which enables searching for good architectures automatically without excessive manual design. I'm also quite familiar with Object Detection and Segmentation. My future plan is to pursue a PhD degree after graduating from HKU.

Hobbies
======
I started to sing since middle school, becoming a singer was actually my childhood dream. During my undergraduate study, I also joined many singing competitions and won some awards, hook me up if you ever wanna go to KTV! Check out one of my competitions [here](https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzU0MTE5NTE4MA==.html?).<br/>
Other than working and studying, I spend most of my time in the gym or jogging outside, there is a Chinese saying "Body is the capital of revolution", stay healthy, stay strong, my friend.
