We developed an IoT device that could measure soil statistics (temperature, humidity, etc) and transmit the data to the cloud, which could be furthur analyzed by scientists. The device is currently deployed in Myanmar. During the trip, we had the chance to experience Myanmar culture as well as sharing knowledge with local students.
